# This version of PPPwn, is a "modified" version of it taken from https://github.com/xfangfang/PPPwn_cpp/ and the stage1 and stage2 files are put into the root of the pppwn.exe
This version is literally just stolen, credits to the owner: xfangfang.
# Do NOT come crying to me if you cant use it, not my problem.
This version is not modified and basically normal, but you can use it through the command prompt. 
If you want to modify this, go ahead. I dont mind.
# Just notice that this is not the original version, Thanks for trying if you did.
